# Degrees of Separation of Music Artists

This is a project based on [Six Degrees of Separation] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation) written
in Python and using the Spotipy library

## TODO
- Optimize BFS (when I'm less sleepy!)
- Sort returned tracks by relevance
- Optimize number of elements returned in each search
- Create Track class to display additional information e.g. track title
